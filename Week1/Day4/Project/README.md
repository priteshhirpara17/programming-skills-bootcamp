# Project: User Registration and Verification

This project involves creating a user registration and verification system using Core Java. The system should allow users to register their email and password, store the data into a list/hashmap, and verify their credentials upon login.

## Requirements

### 1. User Registration

* Create a class User to store user information, with instance variables email and password.
* Take input from the user for their email and password.
* Create an object of User and store the user data into a list/hashmap.

### 2. User Verification

* Take input from the user for their email and password to verify.
* Search for the user in the list/hashmap using their email as the key.
* If the user is found, compare their stored password with the entered password.
* If the entered password matches the stored password, print "Login Success" and exit the program.
* If the entered password does not match the stored password, print "Wrong credentials" and exit the program.

### 3.Store Data in Text File

* Use IO concepts to store the user data into a text file.
* Create a switch case menu to allow the user to choose whether to register or login.
* Depending on the choice, perform the corresponding action and store/retrieve data from the text file.

## Additional Considerations

* Use object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation and inheritance to structure the code.

* Handle exceptions and errors properly to provide a user-friendly experience.
  
* Add additional features such as password encryption and user account management (e.g. password reset) to enhance the functionality of the system

## Conclusion

In this project, you will create a user registration and verification system using Core Java, incorporating object-oriented programming, IO concepts, and exception handling. By the end of the project, you will have gained experience in implementing a real-world use case and be able to apply your knowledge to other projects in the future.
